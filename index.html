            <p class="about-me"> I am currently a student at Simon Fraser University in the Computer Science program with a key interest in Software Development and Data Science. 
                Further side interests that I have already started diving into include Artificial Intelligence, Game Design, and Web Development. I have a passion for coding and an even greater hunger for learning, so I am always looking for new opportunities for self-growth!

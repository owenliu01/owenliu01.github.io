                <p class="about-me"> I am currently a student at Simon Fraser University in the Computer Science program with a key interest in Software Development and Data Science. 
                    Further side interests that I have already started diving into include Artificial Intelligence, Game Design, and Web Development. My love for the field and continuous self-growth drive me, so I am always looking for new opportunities to further develop as a programmer and as a person!
